# hapttics Nearby Wireless Listener
hapttics Nearby Wireless Listener is a Node application that uses a Raspberry Pi + WiFi anthenna in monitor mode, to collect WiFi probes with the aim to detect the presence of wireless devices. The presence is detected with no active interaction from the devices around, getting details like mac address, signal strength, date, time, among others.

Although there are other similar projects in GitHub, this one is a more comprehensive one which includes device management, and telemetry transmission to a cloud service in near real-time.
